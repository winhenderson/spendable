1. Create an account
2. Add a bank -> fetch current month transactions and put them in the db and state
3. go back a month -> fetch that month's transactions and add them to the db and the state
4. Go forward a month -> check the current month for updates/new transactions
5. Add a new bank -> get all transactions for the current month
6. Log out + sign in again -> get new transactions for current month
7. go back a month -> check month for new transactions
8. Ignore a transaction -> change the db + optimistically update. Somehow fix the little flicker thing from optimistcally updating and the double click problem

It seems like every time the month changes i need to fetch the transactions again from plaid and modify/add to the db and state
